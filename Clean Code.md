## The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two 
George Miller

>The Magic number 7 (plus or minus two) provides evidence for the capacity of short term memory. Most adults can store between 5 and 9 items in their short-term memory.Â  This idea was put forward by Miller (1956) and he called it the magic number 7

## Nullability
JSON offers no gaurentee that data coming in on properties will not be null. It can be null. Thus, it likely makes sense to mark all properties on DTO's as nullable.

```
public class ReservationDto
{
	public string? At { get; set; }
	public string? Email { get; set; }
	public string? Name { get; set; }
	public int Quantity { get; set; }
}
```

## Immutability
Prefer immutable objects that garuntee the state isn't changing. This makes systems much easier to debug and they are threadsafe by default.

## Thresholds 
Create a set of maximums that if exceeded trigger a discussion on refactoring a block of code. Use linteres where possible.

	- 120 Characters per row
	- No more than 40 lines per method
	- No more than 7 variables per method
	- No more than 4 Dependencies per class

## Postel's Law
Be liberal in what you accept for input, but strict in output. [Robustness principle - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)

## Be careful with ORM's

## Feature Flags over branches
Prefer feature flags to long lived feature branches. This way code stays up to date on the mainline.
